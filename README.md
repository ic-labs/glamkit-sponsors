# GLAMkit sponsors

This is a simple app to implement sponsor logos in GLAMkit pages

## Installation

These instructions presume you already have an ICEkit project set up.

* Add `sponsors` to `settings.INSTALLED_APPS`.
* Run migrations.

## To use

You can add logos and URLs to the "Sponsors" section of the admin.

When you create a piece of rich content, you will be able to start and end a
sponsor block and add rows of sponsors to each block.
